/**
 * SolverPort — the abstract contract for a SPICE solver as Velxio
 * consumes it.  This is a Hexagonal-style port: domain code depends on
 * the interface, and adapters in ./adapters/ implement it against
 * concrete WASM builds or test fakes.
 *
 * Design rationale:
 *   - The domain (MixedModeScheduler, CircuitSimulationService) must
 *     not depend on Web Worker semantics, the vendored WASM, or any
 *     particular ngspice version.  Swapping engines (or going node-
 *     native in tests) only touches an adapter.
 *   - The port surface is intentionally narrow: load a netlist, solve
 *     an analysis, read named vectors, alter a source for incremental
 *     re-solves.  Anything more specific to ngspice is below this line.
