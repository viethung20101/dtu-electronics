/**
 * PinResolver — abstraction over "what's driving this component pin?".
 *
 * Background
 * ----------
 * Until Phase 0 of the mixed-mode simulator project, every component
 * handler in simulation/parts/*Parts.ts wired its own subscription to
 * `pinManager.onPinChange(arduinoPin, callback)` after resolving the
 * arduinoPin via the `getArduinoPinHelper(componentPinName)` callback
 * passed into `attachEvents`. That couples handlers tightly to the
 * digital event flow and makes it impossible to swap in a SPICE-resolved
 * voltage check without rewriting every handler.
 *
 * This module introduces `PinResolver`: a small interface that hides the
 * "how do I know what state this pin is in?" question behind two methods,
 * `getCurrentState()` and `onChange()`. Handlers ask the resolver for the
 * current state and subscribe for changes; they never touch PinManager
 * directly.
 *
 * Phase 0 ships the DEFAULT IMPLEMENTATION, which is functionally
 * identical to the legacy path — it just routes through PinResolver
 * instead of being inlined in each handler. Zero behavior change.
 *
 * Phase 1 will add a SPICE-resolved implementation that watches
 * `nodeVoltages[net]` and threshold-converts to digital states. That
 * landing point is why the abstraction exists.
 *
 * See ../../project/sim-mixedmode/phase-00-pin-resolver.md
 *     ../../project/sim-mixedmode/phase-01-mixed-mode-coupling.md
 *     (in the velxio-prod repo)

 *   unknown — e.g. SPICE hasn't solved yet). For the Phase 0 default
 *   impl this is synthesised as `state==='HIGH' ? vcc : 0`.
 * - `onChange(cb)` subscribes to state transitions. Returns an
 *   unsubscribe function. The callback fires whenever the state
 *   changes — NOT on every internal pin event (e.g. PWM duty bumps
 *   don't fire as long as the digital state stays HIGH).
